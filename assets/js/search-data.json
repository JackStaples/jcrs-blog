            "content": "In Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s book &#39;Outliers&#39;, which coined the now pervasive ten thousand hour rule, he brings up an interesting aspect of professional hockey. He discusses the birth dates of players, and how there is a trend for players who make it to the upper echelons of the hockey world tend to be born earlier in the year. This chapter is based on the work of a group of canadian phsycologists (R.H. Barnsley, A.H. Thompson, and P.E. Barnsley) who published their paper &#39;Hockey Success and Relative Birthdate: The Relative Age Effect&#39; in 1995. At the time they found that 32.0% of hockey players in the National Hockey League (NHL) where born in the months of January, February, and March. Only 16.2% where born in the months of October, November, and December. Their findings for the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and the Western Hockey League (WHL) as very similar. They conclude that this is likely the result of how players are grouped into hockey when they are first entering the game. Players born in the early months of the year have the advantage of being the oldest players in their groupings, so they are generally bigger, stronger, and faster. . Since reading about this, its stuck in the back of my mind. Does this observation still hold true for todays players? Does it have any effect of the role players have on their teams? Are players born in September more likely to become goal scoring phenoms like Alex Ovechkin (born september 17th)? What about January born players, are they likely to score a ton of points like current superstar Connor McDavid (born January 13th)? . Luckily, the NHL provides easy access to this data through its open API, and with the power of python its easy enough to see that in fact this claim that more players from the start of the year make it to the NHL does hold up: . There is that same trend, very clearly displayed in the pool of players who have played more than 9 games since the NHL lockout in 2005. Being born in February looks to give you the best chance to make the NHL with 331 players born that month, with November being the far worst with a paltry 173 players. A better way to visualize this is perhaps to pool the players into 4 categories based on the time of year they are born. Lets take a look with four categories, Early (January, February, March), Early Middle (April, May, June), Late Middle (July, August, September), and Late (October, November, December). . There are 957 players born in the &#39;Early&#39; grouping months, while there are only 600 players born in the &#39;Late&#39; grouping. That means that 30.6% of players fall into &#39;Early&#39; and 19.2% are categorized as &#39;Late&#39;. That is very close to the 32.9% to 16.2% that was found by Barnsley et al. in 1985. It means the for every 10 players born in the months of October, November, or December who make the NHL there are roughly 16 making it born in the months of January, February, or March. This is just a visualization and its not attempting to prove statistically significance, but those numbers certainly suggest a very pronounced correlation. . &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Bokeh Plot . .",
