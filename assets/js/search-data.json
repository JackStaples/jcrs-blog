            "content": "In Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s book &#39;Outliers&#39;, which coined the now pervasive ten thousand hour rule, he discusses an interesting trended seen in professional hockey. Players who make it to the upper echelons of the hockey world tend be born in the earlier months of the year. The chapter where Gladwell discusses this is based on the work of a group of canadian phsycologists (R.H. Barnsley, A.H. Thompson, and P.E. Barnsley) who published their paper &#39;Hockey Success and Relative Birthdate: The Relative Age Effect&#39; in 1985. At the time they found that 32.0% of hockey players in the National Hockey League (NHL) where born in the months of January, February, and March. In contrast, only 16.2% where born in the months of October, November, and December. Their findings for the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and the Western Hockey League (WHL) where very similar. They conclude that this was likely the result of how players are grouped in minor hockey leagues. In Canada you&#39;re placed into your division based on your age on December 31st. This means that players born in the early months of the year have the advantage of being the oldest players in their groupings. They will be bigger, stronger, faster, and more mentally developed than the other players in their pool. Thats a significant advantage in a game like hockey. . But this trend was observed in 1985. Does it still hold true for todays players? Taking it further than that, does the month a player is born have an effect on what their career looks like as a professional hockey player? Are players born in September more likely to become goal scoring phenoms like Alex Ovechkin (born september 17th)? What about January born players, are they likely to become point scoring superstars like Connor McDavid (born January 13th)? While both those players almost certainly qualify as outliers, is it possible that this trend extends further than just the pool of players playing the game, but to the actual performance on the ice as well? Is there a pronounced difference in the stats of players in the early months of the year when compared to the later months of the year? . Luckily, the NHL provides easy access to the data required to investigate this through its open API. Using it I created a dataset that includes any players who has played more than 9 games in one season since the NHL lockout in 2005. With that dataset and the power of Python its easy enough to see that the trend where more players born the early months of the year make it to the NHL still holds up today: . There is that same trend observed in 1985, very clearly displayed in the players of the &quot;modern&quot; era of the NHL. Being born in February looks to give you the best chance to make the NHL with 331 players born that month. In opposition, November registers by far the lowest with just 173 players. A better way to visualize this is perhaps to pool the players into 4 categories based on the time of year they are born. Lets take a look with four categories, Early (January, February, March), Early Middle (April, May, June), Late Middle (July, August, September), and Late (October, November, December) similar to how they looked in the original paper. . There are 957 players born in the &#39;Early&#39; grouping months, while there are only 600 players born in the &#39;Late&#39; grouping. That means that 30.6% of players fall into &#39;Early&#39; and 19.2% are categorized as &#39;Late&#39;. That is very close to the 32.9% to 16.2% found by Barnsley et al. in 1985. It means that for every 10 players born in the months of October, November, or December who make the NHL there are roughly 16 making it born in the months of January, February, or March. This is just a visualization and its not attempting to prove statistically significance, but those numbers certainly suggest a very pronounced correlation. . &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Bokeh Plot . .",
