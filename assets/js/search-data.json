            "content": "In Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s book &#39;Outliers&#39;, which coined the now pervasive ten thousand hour rule, he discusses an interesting trend in professional hockey. Players who make it to the upper echelons of the hockey world tend be born in the earlier months of the year. The chapter wherein Gladwell discusses this is phenomenon is based on the work of a group of canadian phsycologists (R.H. Barnsley, A.H. Thompson, and P.E. Barnsley) who published their paper &#39;Hockey Success and Relative Birthdate: The Relative Age Effect&#39; in 1985. At the time they found that 32.0% of hockey players in the National Hockey League (NHL) where born in the months of January, February, and March. In contrast, only 16.2% where born in the months of October, November, and December. Their findings for the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and the Western Hockey League (WHL) where very similar. They conclude that this was likely the result of how players are grouped in minor hockey leagues. In Canada you&#39;re placed into your division based on your age on December 31st. This means that players born in the early months of the year have the advantage of being the oldest players in their groupings. They will be bigger, stronger, faster, and more mentally developed than the players they are competing against. Thats a significant advantage in a game like hockey. . But this trend was observed in 1985. Does it still hold true for todays players? Taking it further than that, does the month a player is born have an effect on what their career looks like as a professional hockey player? Are players born in September more likely to become goal scoring phenoms like Alex Ovechkin (born september 17th)? What about January born players, are they likely to become point scoring superstars like Connor McDavid (born January 13th)? While both those players almost certainly qualify as outliers, is it possible that this trend extends further than just the pool of players playing the game, but to the actual performance on the ice as well? Is there a pronounced difference in the stats of players in the early months of the year when compared to the later months of the year? . Luckily, the NHL provides easy access to the data required to investigate this through its open API. Using it I created a dataset that includes any players who has played more than 9 games in one season since the NHL lockout in 2005. With that dataset and some Python its easy enough to see that the trend still holds up today: . Just as observed in 1985, there are substantially more players whose birthdays fall closer to the beginning of the calendar year than the end. Being born in February looks to give you the best chance to make the NHL with 331 players born that month. In opposition, November registers by far the lowest with just 173 players. A better way to visualize this is perhaps to pool the players into 4 categories based on the time of year they are born. Lets take a look with four categories, Early (January, February, March), Early Middle (April, May, June), Late Middle (July, August, September), and Late (October, November, December) similar to how they looked in the original paper. . There are 957 players born in the &#39;Early&#39; grouping months, while there are only 600 players born in the &#39;Late&#39; grouping. That means that 30.6% of players fall into &#39;Early&#39; and 19.2% are categorized as &#39;Late&#39;. That is very close to the 32.9% to 16.2% found by Barnsley et al. in 1985. It means that for every 10 players born in the months of October, November, or December who make the NHL there are roughly 16 making it born in the months of January, February, or March. This is just a visualization and its not attempting to prove statistically significance, but those numbers certainly suggest a very pronounced correlation. . So given that the trend certainly looks to be holding in todays NHL, lets explore a little deeper. Below is a boxplot without outliers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot). Outliers marks are left off because while its interesting to see just how much Alex Ovechkin has dominated goal scoring the past 20 years, its not the goal here. The goal instead is to get a high level view of the career statistics of NHL players based on the month they where born. . &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Bokeh Plot . . Looking through the data like this, I noticed two interesting trends. . The Late and Middle Late categories appear to perform at a higher level than the earlier groupings. | Players born in April, May, and June appear to be the lowest performing group, especially below the 50th percentile | It appears that while there are far fewer players making it from the late months, those who do have longer careers with higher scoring rates than those born in earlier months. They&#39;re recording substantially more goals, assists, penalty minutes, shots, hits, powerplay goals, powerplay assists, blocked shots, and shifts. But there&#39;s a caveat to this. However, they are also playing more games, so it follows somewhat that they are going to have higher stat totals. The real question is, are these players outperforming players born in the earlier categories, or is there another factor to it? To do that we can explore on a per game basis, which we will just after looking at the second trend. . As for the spring slump. This trend is really surprising to me, considering players born in the months of April, May, and June are the second most likely to make it to the NHL. 27.4% of players fall into the &#39;Early Middle&#39; category, only slightly lower than the 29.8% observed in 1985. By median (50th percentile) players the &#39;Early Middle&#39; category is last in every single one except for shooting percentage (more on that later). It does improve as you reach the higher percentile players, passing the &#39;Early&#39; grouping in a few stats, but it never comes closer to the later groupings of the year. . Both of these trends could be related to games played though. Is it possible that players born in the spring are more injury prone? To investigate this here is the previous barchart but with the statistics on a per game basis: . x_value = &#39;assists&#39; y_value = &#39;Year Grouping&#39; categories = career_stats_by_game_df[y_value].unique().tolist() # if lower bound is less than zero, zero it def greaterThanZero(x): return x if (x &gt; 0) else 0 sources = {} source_dfs = {} x_axis_values = career_stats_by_game_df.select_dtypes([number]).columns for x_axis_value in x_axis_values: df = career_stats_by_game_df[[ y_value, x_axis_value, ]] groups = df.groupby(y_value) q1 = groups.quantile(q=0.25).reindex(categories) q2 = groups.quantile(q=0.5).reindex(categories) q3 = groups.quantile(q=0.75).reindex(categories) iqr = q3 - q1 upper = q3 + 1.5*iqr lower = q1 - 1.5*iqr lower[x_axis_value] = lower[x_axis_value].apply(greaterThanZero) source_dict = { &#39;y&#39;: categories, &#39;lower&#39;: lower[x_axis_value], &#39;q1&#39;: q1[x_axis_value], &#39;q2&#39;: q2[x_axis_value], &#39;q3&#39;: q3[x_axis_value], &#39;upper&#39;: upper[x_axis_value] } source_dfs[x_axis_value] = source_dict tooltips = &quot;&quot;&quot; &lt;div&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;@y&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;Lower bounds: @lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;First quartile: @q1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;Median: @q2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;Third quartile: @q3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;Upper bounds: @upper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot; p = figure(y_range=categories, tooltips=tooltips, aspect_ratio=1.5) source = ColumnDataSource(data=source_dfs[x_value]) hbar = HBar( y=&#39;y&#39;, height=0.6, left=&#39;q1&#39;, right=&#39;q3&#39;, fill_color = Colorblind[8][0] ) lower_segment = Segment(x0=&#39;lower&#39;, y0=&#39;y&#39;, x1=&#39;q1&#39; ,y1=&#39;y&#39;) upper_segment = Segment(x0=&#39;q3&#39;, y0=&#39;y&#39;, x1=&#39;upper&#39; ,y1=&#39;y&#39;) lower_rect = Rect(x=&#39;lower&#39;, y=&#39;y&#39;, width=0.001, height=0.8) middle_rect = Rect(x=&#39;q2&#39;, y=&#39;y&#39;, width=0.001, height=0.8) upper_rect = Rect(x=&#39;upper&#39;, y=&#39;y&#39;, width=0.001, height=0.8) p.add_glyph(source, hbar) p.add_glyph(source, lower_segment) p.add_glyph(source, upper_segment) p.add_glyph(source, lower_rect) p.add_glyph(source, middle_rect) p.add_glyph(source, upper_rect) x_select = Select(title=&quot;Select Stat&quot;, options=x_axis_values.tolist(), value=x_value) x_select.js_on_change(&quot;value&quot;, CustomJS(args=dict(source=source, sources=sources, source_dfs=source_dfs), code=&quot;&quot;&quot; source.data = source_dfs[this.value]; source.change.emit(); &quot;&quot;&quot;)) columns = [ TableColumn(field=&#39;y&#39;, title=&#39;Grouping&#39;), TableColumn(field=&quot;lower&quot;, title=&#39;0th Percentile&#39;), TableColumn(field=&quot;q1&quot;, title=&#39;25th Percentile&#39;), TableColumn(field=&quot;q2&quot;, title=&#39;50th Percentile&#39;), TableColumn(field=&quot;q3&quot;, title=&#39;75th Percentile&#39;), TableColumn(field=&quot;upper&quot;, title=&#39;100th Percentile&#39;), ] table = DataTable(source=source, columns=columns, index_position=None, aspect_ratio=3) layout = column(p, table, x_select) output_file(&#39;boxplot.html&#39;) # show the results show(layout) . This does away with the trend of &#39;Early Middle&#39; seeing a dip from the &#39;Early&#39; category, which is very interesting. Despite what appears to be a slightly better average performance, players born in the &#39;Early Middle&#39; category are playing slightly less games on average than players born in the &#39;Early&#39; category. I&#39;m not really sure what could cause this? Perhaps spring born babies really are just more injury prone. . Per game data does still hold that the players born in later months tend to overperform. Players in those categories are on average scoring more, assisting more, blocking more shots, and playing more shifts. But interestingly they are not recording more hits or penalty minutes than those born in the earlier months. Which leads to what I think the real trend we are seeing here likely is... . Every NHL team needs players to shut down opponents scoring threats, kill penalties, and get in the odd fight. Those are roles where there is a distinct advantage to being bigger and stronger, which is the exact advantage that players born in the earlier months of the year have. This data appears to be showing us that players from the later months of the year are on average outperforming the players born in the earlier months, which is true. But in practice, its really showing us is that players from the earlier months of the year are more likely to slot into lower scoring, more physical, roles. . This is just an exploration exercise, none of this is meant to be proof of anything. Its just meant to uncover where you would begin looking to further explore the effects of birth month on NHL outcome. . ax = sb.displot(data=career_stats_by_game_df, x=&#39;points&#39;, hue=&#39;Year Grouping&#39;, kind=&#39;kde&#39;) . ax = sb.displot(data=career_stats_by_game_df, x=&#39;hits&#39;, hue=&#39;Year Grouping&#39;, kind=&#39;kde&#39;) .",
