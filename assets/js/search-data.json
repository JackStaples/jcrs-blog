            "title": "Exploration of NHL Player Statistics by Birth Month",
            "content": "The ten thousand hour rules, popularized in Malcolm Gladwell&#39;s book Outliers, has become something of a mantra for a subculture of &quot;rise and grinders&quot; who strive to put in the time estimated to achieve mastery in their given vocations. While that is certainly a worthy goal, an element of the book is lost in the kind of &quot;modern myth&quot; which that rule has become. When Gladwell writes about it, he is really pointing out that for many people who do achieve mastery in a field, there is an element of luck that allows them to put in far more time than many others. One example that he gives is the effect the birth month of a hockey player has on their chances of become a professional. Players born in the earlier months of the year seem to make it to the National Hockey League (NHL) in larger numbers than players born in the later months of the year. This post will examine if that rule still holds in todays NHL, and will go further to explore how birth month affects the careers of the players who do make it the NHL. . The chapter of Outliers that dives into this is based on a 1985 paper published by a group of Canadian phsycologist (R.H. Barnsley, A.H. Thompson, and P.E. Barnsley) titled &#39;Hockey Success and Birthdate: The Relative Age Effect&#39;. It gives their findings that almost twice as many players are making it to the NHL who are born in the months of January, February, and March compared to the months of October, November, and December. They found that if you divided the year into half, players from the first half of the year represented a total of 61.8% of the player pool compared to 38.2 for the second half. As well, they found similar numbers in the junior system when examining the Western Hockey League and the Ontario Hockey League. Its thought in the paper that this is the result of something called the Relative Age Effect, the ugly result of age grouping. In Canada, the cutoff date for minor hockey is December 31st of that year. This means a player born in January will be almost a full year older than a player born in December. That gives them a significant advantage, as older children will likely be stronger, faster, and more mentally developed than their opponents. In a competitive game like hockey that is a huge boost and those players become far more likely to be the ones given the opportunities required to make it as a professional athelete. . Before diving into the data I think its important to mention the restrictions I&#39;ve placed on the dataset the below visualizations are built on. . All the data is pulled from the NHL&#39;s open API | No data from the current season is included in the dataset | Only players who have played more than 9 games in one season are included in the dataset | Goaltenders are removed from the dataset, as their statistics don&#39;t compare with other positions | Only players who played after the NHL lockout (2005) are included. For the purposes of this post I&#39;m considering that the &quot;modern era&quot; of the NHL. | So with that said here is how the data breaks out into the 4 categories of Early (born in January, February, March), Early Middle (born in April, May, June), Early Late (born in July, August, September) and Late (born in October, November, and December). . There are 684 players born in the &#39;Early&#39; grouping months, while there are only 459 players born in the &#39;Late&#39; grouping. That means that 30.3% of players fall into &#39;Early&#39; and 20.3% are categorized as &#39;Late&#39;. That is close to the 32.9% to 16.2% found by Barnsley et al. in 1985. It means that for every 10 players born in the months of October, November, or December who make the NHL there are roughly 15 making it born in the months of January, February, or March. This is just a visualization and its not attempting to prove statistically significance, but those numbers certainly suggest a pronounced correlation. . So given that the birth month trend certainly looks to be holding in todays NHL, lets explore a little deeper. Below is a boxplot without outliers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot). It visualizes the different percentiles players from the each grouping fall into. Take the time to filter between the different stats . &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; Bokeh Plot . .",
